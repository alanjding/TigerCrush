Dear ${PERSON1_NAME} and ${PERSON2_NAME},

The birds have sung and the cupids have made their circles around you two!
Looks like you are indeed a match made in heaven.

The job of TigerCrush is done here, so it is up to you to take it away.
Exchange phone numbers, Facebooks, Snapchats, set up a quiet coffee date,
an exciting movie night, or go out on a refreshing Saturday hike, it's all up to you.

Be good and stay frosty.

With love,
The TigerCrush Team
