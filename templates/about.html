          <p>TigerCrush is a platform that enables Princeton undergraduates to see which of their fellow students that they have a crush on are crushing back on them. If TigerCrush identifies such a match, that is, a student you're crushing on is crushing back on you, both of you will be notified via email of the match, and it's up to you to take things from there!<br><br>TigerCrush was developed by Alan Ding '22, Oleg Golev '22, and Geral Huang '22. The development team would like to acknowledge that this application was inspired by GoodCrush, a now-defunct platform created by Princeton alum Josh Weinstein '09 that once served a similar purpose. We would also like to acknowledge the original poster of the Tiger Confession (#15437) that dug up this decade-old relic from the depths of the Internet.</p>
