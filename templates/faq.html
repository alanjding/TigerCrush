          <p class=""><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b>&nbsp;How does TigerCrush work?<br></span><b>Answer.</b>&nbsp;First, enter your crushes into the system in the "Your Crushes" portion of the application. If TigerCrush identifies a match - that is, there is someone you're crushing on who's also crushing on you - that person will show up in the "Your Matches" portion of the application and the two of you will get an email. Where you take the match from there is up to you! If you enter your crushes and don't immediately get a match, it could just be that your crushes might not have accessed TigerCrush yet.<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b> Who all is told that I have a crush on these people?<br></span><b>Answer.</b> Only people that your matched with. If you have a crush on someone who isn't crushing back on you, that person's number of secret admirers increases by 1, but your identity will not be revealed to that person. No one is otherwise able to view another person's crushes.<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b>&nbsp;What's a secret admirer?<br></span><b>Answer.</b>&nbsp;Someone that you don't have a crush on that has a crush on you!<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b>&nbsp;Can I see who exactly my secret admirers are?<br></span><b>Answer.</b>&nbsp;As the name suggests, you are not able to find out who your secret admirers are. This is to encourage people to put their crushes out there without the risk of being found out by anyone not crushing on that person in the first place.<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b> How many crushes am I able to have on TigerCrush?<br></span><b>Answer.</b>&nbsp;5 + (the number of secret admirers you have).<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b>&nbsp;Why not more?<br></span><b>Answer.</b>&nbsp;This feature forces users to think deeply about who they would like to be with most and ensures that the relationships that result from TigerCrush are as fulfilling as possible.<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b> When is the last chance for me to be matched?<br></span><b>Answer.</b> The first round of TigerCrush will last until [date]. Still not matched by then? Don't worry - we will be running subsequent rounds of TigerCrush as long as the demand is there!<br><br><span class="text-primary"><b class="text-primary">Question.</b> Can the development team look up who my secret admirers are? Can development team look up my crushes?<br></span><b>Answer.</b> Your privacy and comfort in using this application are valuable to us - we really do mean this. While, for full disclosure, we would have the ability to perform database dives that reveal this information, we promise never to do so. This means we would not be able to tell you who your secret admirers are and that we also would not be able to figure out who your crushes are. If don't trust that we will abide by this promise, you, of course, reserve the right to not use this application.</p>
