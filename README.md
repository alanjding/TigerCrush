# TigerCrush

The one and only Tinder-defying application specifically for Princeton students. Add your crushes and see if they crush on you back. Revive your hopes and live your dreams with the love of your life through TigerCrush!

This app is a revival of the old GoodCrush platform, the brainchild of Josh Weinstein '09. It retains very similar functionality, allowing students to indicate as many crushes as they wish, and contacting two matched students if and only if the first student put down the second as a crush and vice versa. Users will also be able to see the number of students crushing on them whom they did not indicate to be a crush of their own. No "missed connection" feature is planned, since we believe Tiger Confessions++ serves that purpose already. Princeton students must log on with Princeton's CAS (Central Authentication Service), so the platform is closed to Princeton students only.
